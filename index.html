<p>Synopsis:

    Events before the start of Hamlet set the stage for tragedy. When the king of Denmark, Prince Hamlet’s father,
     suddenly dies, Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude, marries his uncle Claudius, who becomes the new king.
    A spirit who claims to be the ghost of Hamlet’s father describes his murder at the hands 
    of Claudius and demands that Hamlet avenge the killing. When the councilor Polonius
     learns from his daughter, Ophelia, that Hamlet has visited her in an apparently 
     distracted state, Polonius attributes the prince’s condition to lovesickness, and 
     he sets a trap for Hamlet using Ophelia as bait.</p>

        <p>To confirm Claudius’s guilt, Hamlet arranges for a play that mimics the murder;
             Claudius’s reaction is that of a guilty man. Hamlet, now free to act, mistakenly 
             kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius. Claudius sends Hamlet away as part of a 
             deadly plot.

            After Polonius’s death, Ophelia goes mad and later drowns. Hamlet, who has returned 
            safely to confront the king, agrees to a fencing match with Ophelia’s brother, Laertes,
             who secretly poisons his own rapier. At the match, Claudius prepares poisoned wine for 
             Hamlet, which Gertrude unknowingly drinks; as she dies, she accuses Claudius, whom 
             Hamlet kills. Then first Laertes and then Hamlet die, both victims of Laertes’
              rapier.

            <p>BARNARDO  Who’s there?
                    FRANCISCO 
                    Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
                    BARNARDO  Long live the King!
                    FRANCISCO  Barnardo?
                    BARNARDO  He.
                    FRANCISCO 
                    You come most carefully upon your hour.
                    BARNARDO 
                    ’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
                    FRANCISCO 
                    For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold,
                    And I am sick at heart.
                    BARNARDO  Have you had quiet guard?
                    FRANCISCO  Not a mouse stirring.
                    BARNARDO  Well, good night.
                    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
                    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>
